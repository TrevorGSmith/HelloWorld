About Me
My name is Trevor Smith and I am a student at CSUMB, studying computer Science and software engineering. 

Although I find all computer programming interesting and fun, I would like to continue to pursue technology in the biomedical field.
My studies so far have included C++, Java, and Python programming, data structures, multimedia programming, internet programming, and much more. In addition I have also achieved two degrees in biological studies and paralegal studies at I.V.C., located in Irvine, CA.

My ultimate career ambition is to work for Google working and developing new technology! Although this is an ambitious goal, I believe with a lot of hard work and research, I will achieve my ambitions.
