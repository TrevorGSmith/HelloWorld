 * Name: Trevor Smith

 * Assignment: 2
 * 
 * This is a casino slots game where user can input a bet amount 1-100 and get three random options from "BAR",
 * "cherries", "space", and "7", which are repeatable.  Each option has a different probability, and different
 * combinations of the options leads to different winnings multipliers.  The user can input 0 to quit at any time, and 
 * will be shown their individual winnings as well as a grand total.
